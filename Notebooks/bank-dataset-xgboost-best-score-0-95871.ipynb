Episode 8). The objective was to predict the probability that a bank\n","client would subscribe to a term deposit using demographic, financial, and\n","campaign-related features.\n","\n","A leakage-free preprocessing pipeline was implemented using\n","`ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`, followed by an XGBoost classifier with\n","explicit handling of class imbalance via `scale_pos_weight`. Model performance\n","was evaluated primarily using ROC–AUC, which is more appropriate than accuracy\n","for imbalanced classification tasks.\n","\n","The baseline XGBoost model achieved strong generalization, with a public\n","leaderboard score of **0.95979** and a private leaderboard score of **0.95871**.\n","Subsequent hyperparameter tuning using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation\n","resulted in comparable performance and improved stability, achieving a public\n","score of **0.95965** and a private score of **0.95873**.\n","\n","Feature importance analysis revealed that contact strategy, previous campaign\n","outcomes, and call duration were the most influential factors in predicting\n","client subscription behavior. These insights align well with real-world banking\n","and marketing intuition.\n","\n","Overall, this project demonstrates a robust and well-validated approach to\n","large-scale tabular classification, combining sound preprocessing, appropriate\n","metric selection, careful model tuning, and clear interpretability. Future work\n","could include SHAP-based explanations, cost-sensitive threshold optimization,\n","and advanced ensembling techniques.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":12937777,"sourceId":91719,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31259,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":869.254414,"end_time":"2026-01-28T15:11:32.436776","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2026-01-28T14:57:03.182362","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
